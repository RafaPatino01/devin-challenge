## The Challenge

The task manager had a bug where the "Add New Task" modal was pre-filled with data from the last edited task instead of being blank. This is a common React component reuse issue.

## Devin's Solution Process

1. **Analysis**: Devin analyzed the issue with 95% confidence
2. **Planning**: Created a detailed implementation plan
3. **Explanation**: Provided voice explanation of the root cause
4. **Implementation**: Fixed the issue by properly resetting form data in the `handleClose` function
5. **Pull Request**: Automatically created a GitHub PR with the fix

## Key Features Demonstrated

- âœ… Autonomous issue analysis and planning
- âœ… Voice interface for explanations
- âœ… Live coding session
- âœ… Automatic GitHub integration
- âœ… Pull request creation with documentation

## Running the Project

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
